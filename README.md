# Assembler
Assembler built to be used for FPGA microprocessor.  

Lots of work left to do

Currently able to assemble an asm file(for custom microprocessor) if it has less than 255 bytes of code.

Need to implement ASCII support as well as areas to declare bytes, words, etc.

Labels currently can only be used within brackets so that needs to be fixed as well.
